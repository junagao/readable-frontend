## Things to figure out

1. Have you watched the Udemy videos about using objects in redux's reducer? What did you think about this approach? Is it better using objects or arrays? I ended up using objects as the example in Udemy. But it would be nice to hear your opinion on this.
2. How can I render the CreateComment form component below the comments?
3. How to add ascending and descending to sorting?
4. How to use the same Rating component for both posts and comments?



## To do

1. ~~Vote up and down posts~~
2. Sort posts by date or vote
3. ~~Fix PostDetail router to `/:category/:post_id~~`
4. ~~Add comments counter to PostDetail~~
5. ~~Add edit / delete button to PostDetail~~
6. Add vote to comments
7. Add button and form to create a new comment in PostDetail
