# Readable

Readable is a HackerNews/reddit inspired thread app. It's a basic blogging system that has posts and comments. Users can post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This is my second project for Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.

I chose to build this project from scratch using React, Webpack, Babel, ESlint, instead of using plain Create React App.
